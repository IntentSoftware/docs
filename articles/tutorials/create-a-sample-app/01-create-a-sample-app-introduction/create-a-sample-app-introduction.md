# Tutorial: Create a Sample App

This tutorial will walk you through using already existing [Module](xref:references.modules)s in Intent Architect to quickly create a working sample application.

## What is Intent Architect?

Intent Architect is a non-prescriptive, integrated, architecture-design platform that combines together the power of visual modeling, code-management and pattern-reuse to help software development teams build enterprise-grade, scalable applications at lightning speed.

## What will the sample application be?

The sample application will be a PetClinic application which is a fictional, but easily understandable and plausible business domain of running a "pet clinic". It was originally [created by the Spring team](https://projects.spring.io/spring-petclinic/) to demonstrate how one could use various Spring features to build an application.

We have chosen to also use it when demonstrating how Intent Architect can be used.
